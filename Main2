Here is a simple Python script using the `requests` library to send a GET request to a specified URL:

```python
import requests

url = "https://www.example.com"  # Replace this with the URL you want to request

# Send a GET request to the URL
response = requests.get(url)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Request was successful")
    print("Response:")
    print(response.text)
else:
    print("Request was not successful. Status code:", response.status_code)
```

Make sure you have the `requests` library installed. You can install it using the following command:

```
pip install requests
```

Replace `"https://www.example.com"` with the URL you want to request. Run this script in a Python environment to send a GET request to that URL.
